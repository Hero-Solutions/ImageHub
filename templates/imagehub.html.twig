        <h1>Imagehub</h1>
        <p>The Imagehub is a web application based on the Symfony framework and has two main components: a IIIF Image API, and a IIIF Presentation API. Read all about the IIIF Presentation API implementation on the <a href="{{ path('iiif') }}">IIIF page</a>.
            The IIIF Image API consists of a Cantaloupe Image server exposing digitised 2D images of artworks by
            Flemish Cultural Heritage institutions.</p>
        <p>The images made available through Cantaloupe can be processed and transformed in any way
            the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/">IIIF Image API 2.1.1</a> allows.</p>
        <p>The Imagehub is designed to be used in conjunction with the <a href="http://datahub.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/">Datahub</a> to create two platforms that openly exchange both image data and object metadata.
            These two platforms can be used as a basis to create re-use applications for cultural heritage collection
            discovery. The Flemish Art Collection's main reuse application is the Arthub Flanders,
            which uses the datahub for metadata delivery in the LIDO XML format and the imagehub for delivery of
            images in manifest.json format. These manifest.json files are loaded into a IIIF viewer on collection pages of Flemish Cultural Heritage institutions.</p>
