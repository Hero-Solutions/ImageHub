        <h1>IIIF</h1>
        <p>IIIF frees up your images to be creatively reused. Because scaling, cropping and zooming become trivial
            operations, youâ€™re free to concentrate on the important task of providing a great user experience.
            You also benefit from great image viewing software written and maintained by other people, so no need to reinvent
            the wheel.</p>
        <p>In IIIF, objects are defined as manifests. A manifest is a JSON-LD document that describes the structure of
            each artwork. The manifests are used in the imagehub to serve images and the technical and administrative metadata needed to view
            those images in an embedded online viewer. The imagehub features an implementation of the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/">IIIF Presentation API 3.0</a>.</p>
        <p>Find the IIIF Presentation API endpoint at <a href="{{ base_url }}{{ main_iiif_version }}/">{{ base_url }}{{ main_iiif_version }}/</a></p>
        <p>All manifests available in this API endpoint can be found in a top-level IIIF collection at <a href="{{ path('collection', {'iiifVersion': main_iiif_version}) }}">{{ path('collection', {'iiifVersion': main_iiif_version}) }}</a></p>
        <p>You can find more information about the IIIF Presentation and Image APIs at <a href="http://iiif.io">iiif.io</a></p>
